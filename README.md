# Predicting-Red-Hat-Business-Value
Kaggle problem 

Created a classification algorithm that identifies which customers have the most potential business value for Red Hat based on their characteristics and activities.

• Performed exploratory data analysis on a large set of training data and applied cross validation technique to stack ensemble different training algorithm (Two class Boosted DT, Neural Networks, SVM) to find the best method of classification.
• Used feature selection technique for dimensionality reduction, increasing the efficiency to tune model hyperparameters.
• Merged datasets and visualized the data set features to handle missing values and outliers using ggplot package in R.
